                  Tax is a financial charge imposed by governments on individuals and
                  businesses to generate revenue. This money funds public services
                  like education, healthcare, infrastructure, and social programs.
                  Taxes come in various forms, such as income tax, sales tax, property
                  tax, and excise tax. The specific types and rates of taxes can vary
                  by country and jurisdiction.
